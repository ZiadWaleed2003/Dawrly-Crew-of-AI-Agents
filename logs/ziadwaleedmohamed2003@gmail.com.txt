1. For each string in `search_queries`, call the `tavily_search_engine_tool` exactly once to execute it.
   - Use the search_queries directly from input if available, otherwise use the ones from the previous task.
2. From the tool output, extract raw results; for each result:
- Determine `platform` based on URL domain.
- Visit or use the provided `content` snippet to verify presence of required skills and location.
- Score each result (0-10) according to:
    * Title match (3)
    * Required skills presence (3)
    * Location/remote alignment (2)
    * Platform credibility (2)
- Only include results with `score` >= 0.
- Populate `relevance_notes` explaining the score.
